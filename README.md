Welcome to the **Android Bootanimation Previewer**! üëã This Python script allows you to quickly and easily preview `bootanimation.zip` files right on your desktop, saving you the hassle of flashing or rebooting your Android device every time you want to see a new boot animation.

Whether you're a ROM developer, a theming enthusiast, or just curious about what's inside a `bootanimation.zip`, this tool is for you! ‚ú®

## üöÄ Features

* **Flexible File Input:** Preview any `bootanimation.zip` file by specifying its path using a command-line argument.
* **Default File Handling:** If no file is specified, it automatically looks for `bootanimation.zip` in the current working directory.
* **Dual `desc.txt` Format Support:** Accurately parses `desc.txt` files using both `p` (legacy/AOSP) and `c` (Chromium/newer variants) prefixes for animation parts.
* **Multiple Image Format Compatibility:** Supports both `.png` and `.jpg` (including `.jpeg`) image formats commonly found inside `bootanimation.zip` files.
* **Automatic Cleanup:** Extracts the `bootanimation.zip` contents to a temporary folder and automatically cleans it up after the preview session.
* **Informative Console Output:** Provides helpful messages and error indications during the process.

## üì¶ How to Use

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python 3.6+** installed on your system.
You'll also need the following Python libraries. You can install them via `pip`:

```bash
pip install pygame Pillow
```

### 2. Get the Script

1.  Save the provided Python code (your `bootanimation_previewer.py` file) to your local machine.
2.  (Optional but recommended) Rename the file to something descriptive, like `bootanimation_previewer.py` or `preview_bootanimation.py`.

### 3. Run the Previewer

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the script. Then, execute it using one of the following methods:

* **To preview `bootanimation.zip` in the current directory (default):**
    ```bash
    python bootanimation_previewer.py
    ```

* **To preview a specific `bootanimation.zip` file (using the `-f` or `--file` argument):**
    ```bash
    python bootanimation_previewer.py -f "/path/to/your/bootanimation.zip"
    ```
    (Replace `"/path/to/your/bootanimation.zip"` with the actual full path to your file. Use quotes if the path contains spaces!)
* **To change preview scale for `bootanimation.zip`  (using the `-s` or `--scale` argument):**
    ```bash
    python bootanimation_previewer.py -s 0.5
    ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

* **Root Access:** This script previews the animation; it does NOT install it on your device. Installing a boot animation on an Android device typically requires root access or a custom recovery.
* **`bootanimation.zip` Structure:** The `bootanimation.zip` file must be a non-compressed (store method) ZIP archive containing a `desc.txt` file and folders (e.g., `part0`, `part1`) with sequentially numbered image frames.
* **Error Handling:** While the script has basic error handling, highly malformed `bootanimation.zip` files might still cause unexpected behavior.
